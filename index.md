This is the course page
for the seminar course
_Computational Morphology_
at the [Department of Linguistics](http://sfs.uni-tuebingen.de),
[University of Tübingen](http://uni-tuebingen.de).


This is a seminar intends to cover a wide range of different
approaches for computational processing of natural langauge
morphology. We will cover, rule-based (finite-state) systems
as well as data-driven models of both supervised and unsupervised
morphological processing.

This is a typical seminar course, where we will read a selection of
influential and/or recent papers from the literatuere, and discuss
them in the class. The participants will also be required to complete
small projects.

Grading will be based on class participation and leading the
discussion of a paper, or a "replication/reproducion" of one of the
papers discussed (3ECTS). Further course credits can be obtained by 
writing a term paper within the scope of the course.

## Requirements

Prior knowledge to NLP and machine learning is required.
